## Signed and Sealed

When it comes to writing,
Expect an end, a sign off so clear and specific,
A prediction and conclusions to. How can we forget the heading
And just to make it extra,
we add the envelope, enclosing the content from external eyes,
Well this days maybe compress the file to a single title
Signed and sealed Very professional it is.
The security of having that confirms a million things
The senders intentionality,
The precision and confirmation that it’s only yours
A step back, into the year
What is signed and sealed is and has always been yours, no one can take that away from you or make claims against it.
It’s plainly and clearly stated.
And in things we say put our efforts into the people we intentionally allow into our lives
Our work dreams and efforts are a signed and sealed contract that belongs to us
We fight for them, put in the extra work for it is our Joy to bring them into completion
Yes, we claim them and we work for it, making sure we enjoy it
As a child of God, I couldn’t stop but remember how intentional God has been to call me his.
He put in the work, made a way for me to reach him 😭 (premium tears)
Made me for him, marked me for him, he knew everything and provides everything I need
Even before I ask
If this isn’t the biggest form of love I have seen, I don’t want any other.
A complete signed and sealed relationship.
So I take the hints
And push with it, walk in it and when I open the letter I receive everything
Because it is mine 🙌🏽😍, the happiness it brings aahhhh!!! dear heavens
All mine.
