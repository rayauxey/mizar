## A Wanderer

Its valentine alright hahaha‚Ä¶ Happy valentines my charming reader.

### A Valentine's Reflection

I do feel the environment loudly pointing, the Ads and crazy offers, don‚Äôt forget the events happening, all those seem to stick out even when I close my eyes.
I haven‚Äôt looked forward to this particular event in years (little confession) regardless I‚Äôm hopeful to feel valentines everyday for ever one day. And so should you, keep looking forward to one full of smiles and tears of Joy that comes with peace and real üòò and if you enjoy this (applause) may it never run out for you.

### The Fellowship's Wisdom

I came a cross a book, "_*THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING BY J.R.R TOLKIEN_" and boy was i blown away. For context i'll take out a an excerpt that says: "Not all those who wander are lost." and right there i build my thoughts today.

### Personal Wanderings

Welcome to my mind dear reader lemme begin with a question, have you ever wandered away? Well, i have followed trails gotten lost and found my way back after wiping my tears from crying out my eyes, hahaha.
Interestingly, when i got to familiar grounds i couldn‚Äôt help but recall the new things i saw , felt and heard while lost. It was like an adventure i didn‚Äôt plan to have but happened I call them Sidequests.

(Borrowed)‚Ä¶ The word ‚Äúwander‚Äù often implies moving without a fixed destination, exploring new paths, and experiencing life in an unplanned way.  Looking back at the quote suggests that wandering, or straying from a conventional path, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean one is aimless or lost. It emphasizes the value of the journey itself, rather than the destination. It‚Äôs edifying to know Sometimes, the most enriching experiences come from uncharted territories, where one can discover new perspectives, insights, and personal growth.
Its good to wander, we find new things, new and forgotten perspectives to even the so called ‚ÄúHidden Gems‚Äù are waiting to be discovered for sure.

### The Quarter Century Mark

I‚Äôve been thinking about my new age‚Ä¶ turning 25 feels like a huge load
more so, i look at 25 and i have an ancient perspective towards it, you know from my parents time (millennial age view)
those guys had their lives figured out by 23 and 25 oh yes marriage  children and then life goes on

I‚Äôve been thinking about my getting to a new age‚Ä¶ turning 25 feels like a huge mark in life.
more so, i look at it and i have an ancient perspective towards it, you know from my parents view (millennial times).
Those guys had their lives figured out by 23 and 25, name it from marriage, to number of children and so on and so forth.  Now I‚Äôm getting to 25 and boy oh boy I‚Äôll have to acquire new age perspective suited and perfectly fitting for me without doubt.
Everyday unlocks new questions and Ideas, surely someone can answer one for me (tears up) or give some clarifying thoughts.To me stumbling onto This particular quote opened my eyes to it, a solution.

### Finding Individuality

Individuality, Wandering can be a way to understand oneself better, to connect with the world on a deeper level, and to find meaning in life through diverse experiences. Like the time i was lost i was able to dig deep and find calmness that pushed me to find my way back.
The unique situation and experience has born new abilities and skills that i now use everyday that makes me different from another, I can‚Äôt wait for my next wandering.
Even as Valentines has come along, our communities have become diverse in that we can see more experiences the joys and sadness all together and making us all valued.

### A Broader Perspective

In a broader sense, this quote encourages an open-minded approach to life. It suggests that just because someone doesn‚Äôt follow a traditional or expected path, it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre lost or misguided.
Instead, they might be discovering new ways to achieve their dreams and aspirations.

Lots of Love
see you on the next one.
